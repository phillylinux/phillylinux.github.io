  <h3>What is PLUG West?</h3>
  <blockquote>
  <p>PLUG West is an extension of <a
  href="/">PLUG</a>,
  the Philadelphia Linux Users Group.  PLUG members are users of the Linux
  operating system and other Open Source software who live in the greater
  Philadelphia area and come together to share knowledge and learn from each
  other.  The monthly PLUG <a href=meetings.html>meeting</a> is typically held
  on the first Wednesday of the month inside the Philadelphia city limits, and
  can be difficult for Linux enthusiasts living in the suburbs to attend.
  Still, many people do make the trek in every month.
  </p>
  <p>PLUG West events are held in the western suburbs of Philadelphia,
  typically in Chester County.  If you are interested in Linux but haven't
  been able to make it to Philadelphia on a Wednesday evening, why not try
  coming to a meeting?</p>

  <h3>Is PLUG West the same as PLUG?</h3>
  <blockquote>
  PLUG West is not a separate group, and does not have its own mailing list
  or web site.  This is deliberate, to encourage a broader sense of
  community.  Membership in PLUG is extremely informal...if you subscribe to
  the <a href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug">PLUG discussion
  list</a> or attend a PLUG (or PLUG West!) meeting you can consider yourself
  a member.
  </blockquote>
  <h3>How can I find out about PLUG West events?</h3>
  <blockquote>
  You can subscribe to the low-traffic <a
  href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug-announce">plug-announce</a>
  mailing list, or to the general <a
  href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug">PLUG discussion
  list</a>.  (All traffic from plug-announce is forward to the discussion
  list, so you only need to subscribe to one of these.)  You can also check
  the list of <a href="meetings.html">upcoming
  meetings</a> on the PLUG website.

  <h3>PLUG events are open to everyone.  If you're interested in Linux,
  you're invited to come and join us!</h3>
