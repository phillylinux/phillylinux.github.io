<h1>PLUG East</h1>
<h3>What is PLUG East?</h3>
<blockquote>PLUG East is an extension of <a href="/">PLUG</a>, the Philadelphia Linux Users Group.

PLUG members are users of the Linux operating system and other Open Source software who live in the greater Philadelphia area and come together to share knowledge and learn from each other.

The monthly PLUG East <a href="meetings.html">meeting</a> is typically held on the third Wednesday of the month at <a href="/locations/dwt.html">Digital Wave Technologies</a> near Horsham PA.

If you are interested in Linux but haven't been able to make it to any other Linux Users Group meeting in Philadelphia on a Wednesday evening, why not try coming to PLUG East meeting?</blockquote>
<h3>Is PLUG East the same as PLUG?</h3>
<blockquote>PLUG East is not a separate group, and does not have its own mailing list or web site. This is deliberate and meant to encourage a broader sense of community and communication. Membership in PLUG is extremely informal...if you subscribe to the <a href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug">PLUG discussion list</a> or attend a PLUG (or PLUG East, North or West!) meeting you can consider yourself a member.</blockquote>
<h3>How can I find out about PLUG East events?</h3>
<blockquote>You can subscribe to the low-traffic <a href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug-announce">plug-announce</a> mailing list, or to the general <a href="http://lists.netisland.net/mailman/listinfo/plug">PLUG discussion</a> list. (All traffic from plug-announce is forwarded to the discussion list, so you only need to subscribe to one of these.) Alternately, you can also check the list of <a href="meetings.html">upcoming meetings</a> on the PLUG website.</blockquote>
<h3>PLUG events are open to everyone. If you're interested in Linux, you're invited to come and join us!</h3>
