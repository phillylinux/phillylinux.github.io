<p>
<a href="http://www.netaxs.com/">Netaxs</a> is a 3 minute walk from the <a
href="http://www.septa.com">SEPTA</a> Spring Mill Station, on the
<a href="http://www.septa.com/schedule.cgi?route=r6n&amp;day=1">R6
Norristown line</a>.

<p>

<dt>Directions by car from center city:
<dd>
  Take 76 West away from the city to exit number 29, Conshohocken.  After
  merging, stay in the right hand lane if possible.  Turn right at the
  eighth light onto North Lane.

  There will be a few large parking lots and a sign that says "Lee Park"
  on your right hand side which you'll want to ignore.  The entrance to
  the best parking lot to use is the very last one before the first light
  (Hector Street) on your right hand side, just about four car lengths
  before the intersection.

  After you park, walk towards the stairs located in the middle of the
  parking lot opposite of North Lane, and continue walking straight to
  the only Lee Park entrance facing Hector Street with a green awning.

<dt>Directions by train:
<dd>
  Take the R6 Norristown line to the Spring Mill station, and walk
  towards the intersection of North Lane and Hector Street, just past
  the station's parking lot.  Hector Street runs more or less parallel
  to the train tracks.  Across it, and to the left, you should be able
  to see the Lee Park office complex.  Cross Hector, turn left, and
  walk away from North Lane to the only Lee Park entrance facing Hector
  street with a green awning.

<dt>Once you reach the building:
<dd>
  Enter by the double doors under the green awning, and walk straight
  back until you reach the auditorium.  There should be signs for PLUG
  on the door and in the hallway.
