<!--
<p>Sentry Park West consists of several buildings, there are a pair of
  twin, four story, white buildings.  The CoreDial offices are in the
  Southern building of the two, closest to Township Line Road.

  The meeting is held in the Conference Room which has a view of the
  main entrance doors of the building which automatically lock around
  6:30 PM, so people may need to be let in as they show up.  You may
  need to approach the conference room windows, to the right of the
  building entrance door, so we can see you are there.</p>

<p>Please refer to the pictures for more detail.</p>

<td valign="top" align=right><h3>Driving<br>Directions:</h3>
<td>
<p>Easiest way is to use <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/i8qEv">this Google Maps Link</a>.</p>

<p>If you are headed West on Germantown pike from the Turnpike turn
   right at Jolly Road. Turn Right on Township Line Road and take your
   next left onto Union Meeting Rd by the highway underpass, then right
   onto Arbor Way. The building will be the first on your right.

<p>There are parking lots on either side of the building, and the main
   lobby entrances are accesible via the courtyard on the East side, or
   the small parking area on the West side.

<tr>
<td valign="top" align=right><h3>Public<br>Transportation:</h3>
<td>

<p>
  The nearest public transit options are SEPTA bus routes 98 and 95.
  <ul>

  <li>If you are taking the SEPTA 98 bus, verbally request to the driver
  that you wish to stop by Union Meeting Road and Arbor Way. When
  returning, you will need to flag down a bus along Union Meeting Road, as
  there is no official bus stop. As an alternative, you can walk to the
  post office.</li>

  <li>If you are taking the SEPTA 95 bus, there is a rather long walk along
  roads that do not have sidewalks. It is possible to walk along Township
  Line Road to Union Meeting Road, then to walk to Arbor Way, but this will
  be at your own risk.
</ul>

You may wish to ask on the PLUG mailing list or IRC channel to see if
someone can pick you up from one of these bus stops, or you may be able
to carpool from your starting point all the way to the meeting location.
If you take the bus, ask your driver for help if you are uncertain.
