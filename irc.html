<title>#PLUG freenode Network Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Channel</title>
<body>

<center><h1>#PLUG</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2>What?</h2>

<p>There is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
channel, <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#PLUG">, on
the <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">freenode</a> IRC network.  It
is a place to talk to other people in PLUG in real time through a text
interface.</p>

<!--<p>IRC (RFC 1459, 5/1993) appears to predate HTML
(RFC 1866, 11/1995) by about 2 years.  It is good.</p>-->

<h2>To Get There:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">www.freenode.net</a>.
<li>Download, install, and run an IRC program listed
on the <a href="http://www.freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml">"Using the Network" page</a>.  (Or
install from one of your Linux distributions packages.)
<li>Connect to one of the servers listed on the <a
href="http://www.freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml">"servers" page</a>.
<li><code>/join #plug</code>
(commands start with "<code>/</code>", channels typically start with "<code>#</code>")
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Idling Strongly Encouraged</h2>
Some channels strongly prefer that you disconnect from IRC when you're away from your computer.  We prefer that you stay around.

<h2>Advantages the #PLUG (<a
href="http://www.freenode.net/">FreeNode</a>)  Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel has over other resources:</h2>

<h3>#Linux (<a href="http://www.freenode.net">FreeNode</a>):</h3>
<ul>
<li>It will be more personal, and you're be a lot more likely to
  get an answer from somebody you may have met than an annonymous face
  amongst the noise.
<li> It's a lot less noisy.
</ul>

<h3>PLUG mailing list:</h3>
<ul>

<li> There are times when you wish to discuss a subject that's not related
to the plug mailing list enough to post it, but which would still be of
sufficient interest to the group to bring up in casual conversation
(realtime chat).

<li> If you have a panic question, it has a fair chance of getting answered
faster in IRC, and interactive discussion is much more smooth and quick.

</ul>

<p><hr>
<h2>Stay for a while</h2>
Once you get to the channel, stay for a bit.  Many of us are in irc at all times, but not necessarily looking at that screen at all times.  If you come into the channel, scream for attention for 3 minutes, then leave, it is really agravating.  Leave it open for at least a half hour.
